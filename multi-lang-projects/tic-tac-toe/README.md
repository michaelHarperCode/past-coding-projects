# Tic Tac Toe
### A programming assignment for Javascript using pre-written HTML, CSS, and some Javascript functions.

This tic-tac-toe assignment sees the implementation of several functions present in `tictactoe.js`. These methods are:
- `newGame()`, which clears the prior tic-tac-toe board, resets values for each portion of the clickable board, and starts a new round.
- `boardButtonClicked()`, which processes both player and computer input when it's their turn.
- `switchTurn()`, which checks to see if the game is finished and, if not, changes whose turn it is. If the game is finished, the relevant message is displayed.
- `makeComputerMove()`, which has the computer player choose an available button at random for their turn.

This was a programming assignment, with the remainder of `tictactoe.js` as well as the present HTML and CSS files being pre-written by the ZyBooks assignment.
