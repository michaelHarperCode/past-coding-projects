# past-coding-projects
A collection of my programming assignments and projects.

This repository contains most programming assignments and personal projects I've worked on between 2019 and 2023.
Some of these files were created collaboratively, while others are of my own. Proper credit will be given at the top of each file.

Files are organized depending on the language used.
